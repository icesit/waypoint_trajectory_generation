# waypoint_trajectory_generation
try to realize a thought of waypoint generation

1. a txt for map generation is needed, the txt, named "map.txt", is like this:
800 600
20 20 780 580
400 300 80
240 300 60
400 140 60
the first line is size of map, second line is start and end point, rest are obstacles in which the first two number is location and last number is size of obstacle.

2. run on vs2015 with opencv.
